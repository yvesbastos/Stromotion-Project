## Synopsis

This Java application is a project for the Universidade Federal de Alagoas (UFAL) class Digital Image Processing 2015.2.
It will receive a video as an input and will produce an image with a **stromotion** [effect](http://www.sportvision.com/sites/default/files/imagerollover_stromotionoly_1.jpg).

## Limitations
Initially, we'll consider:

1. The video has an acceptable resolution (TODO: to be defined)
2. The camera is steady (or moves very little)
3. The environment is well lit
4. The object to be tracked and the background are in different colors. 

## Future Work
